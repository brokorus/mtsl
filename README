This script takes three har files for comparison.

These 3 har files are used to generate an api call library for any site 
converted directly to python. The goal is to automate Stupid things and stop
people from making software arbritrarily difficult to automate.
An optional 4th har file can be used to demonstrate environment variants.

Key goals for library

Identify login credentials and parameterize all calls with a single variable
for the credentials used, then cookies generated/used.

This is done by comparing two har files doing the exact same thing with the
exact same variables

Har file 1.
	Use command+option+i in chrome to record your network traffic.
  Go through what you want to do on that site.
	After you are done, go to your chrome dev console. Hit the red dot to stop recording
	Then right click and save all as har with content. Name it (har1)
	Make sure to log out before beginning again

Har file 2.
	Do the exact same thing as above

Har file 3.
	Do the same workflow as above, but select different options on the pieces you
	want to parameterize

option Har file 4 or more
	Do the same workflow as above, but input the different settings for the a different layer of variablization

Once at least 3 har files are given. The program will begin comparisons of 
bit of them to find where variablization is possible and where/what cookies are
distributed.
